    # Getting Started
    The Lulu Print API allows you to use [Lulu](https://www.lulu.com/) as your production and fulfillment network. The API provides access to the same functionality that Lulu uses internally to normalize files and send Print-Jobs to our production partners around the world.

    The Lulu Print API is a **RESTful API** that communicates with JSON encoded messages. Communication is secured with **OpenID Connect** and **transport layer security** (HTTPS).

    Working with the API requires intermediate level programming skills and a general understanding of web APIs. Check out Lulu's **[printing and fulfillment](https://www.lulu.com/sell)** options without having to do technical work upfront.


    ## Registration
    You have to create an account to start using the Lulu Print API. Your account will automatically receive a client-key and a client-secret.

    ## Sandbox Environment
    The API is available in a production and a sandbox environment. The sandbox can be used for development and testing purposes. Print-Jobs created on the sandbox will never be forwarded to a real production and can be paid for with test credit cards.

    To access the sandbox, you have to create a separate account at https://developers.sandbox.lulu.com/. The sandbox API URL is https://api.sandbox.lulu.com/

    ## Authorization
    The Lulu API uses [OpenID Connect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID_Connect), an authentication layer built on top of [OAuth 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth). Instead of exchanging username and password, the API uses [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token) to authorize client requests.

    To interact with the API you need a **client-key** and a **client-secret**. Open the [Client Keys & Secret](/user-profile/api-keys) page to generate them.

    <img src="/api-docs/assets/keyAndSecretExample.png">

    ## Generate a Token
    To interact with the API you first have to generate an OAuth token. This requires the following parameters:
    * `client_key`
    * `client_secret`
    * `grant-type` must be set to `client_credentials`

    You have to send a POST request to the token endpoint a special Authorization header. For your convenience, you can copy the authorization string directly from your [API Keys](https://developers.lulu.com/user-profile/api-keys) page:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://api.lulu.com/auth/realms/glasstree/protocol/openid-connect/token \
      -d 'grant_type=client_credentials' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
      -H 'Authorization: Basic ZjJjNDdmMTctOWMxZi00ZWZlLWIzYzEtMDI4YTNlZTRjM2M3OjMzOTViZGU4LTBkMjQtNGQ0Ny1hYTRjLWM4NGM3NjI0OGRiYw=='
    ```

    The request will return a JSON response that contains an `access_token` key:

    ```json
    {
        "access_token":"eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCIgOiAiSldUIiwia2lkI...",
        "expires_in":3600,
        "refresh_expires_in":604800,
        "refresh_token":"eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCIgOiAiSldUIiwia2lkIiA6...",
        "token_type":"bearer",
        "not-before-policy":0,
        "session_state":"a856fb91-eafc-460e-8f6a-f09325062c88"
    }
    ```

    Store this `access_token` and use it to authorize all further requests. The token will expire after a few minutes, but you can always request a fresh token from the server as outlined above. We recommend to use an OAuth capable client lib in your favorite programming language to simplify working with client credentials and tokens. Some might even automatically refresh your token after it expired.

    ## Make authenticated requests
    To authenticate subsequent API requests, you must provide a valid access token in the HTTP header of the request:
    `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}`:

    ```bash
    curl -X GET https://api.lulu.com/{some_api_endpoint}/ \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer {access_token}' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
    ```

    ## Select a Product
    Lulu’s Print API offers a wide range of products. Each product is represented by a 27 character code call **pod_package_id**:
    > Trim Size + Color + Print Quality + Bind + Paper + PPI + Finish + Linen + Foil = **pod_package_id**

    Here are a few examples:

    | pod_package_id | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | `0850X1100BWSTDLW060UW444MNG` | `0850X1100`: trim size 8.5” x 11”<br>`BW`: black-and-white<br>`STD`: standard quality <br>`LW`: linen wrap binding<br>`060UW444`: 60# uncoated white paper with a bulk of 444 pages per inch <br>`M`: matte cover coating <br>`N`: navy colored linen<br>`G`: golden foil stamping |
    | `0600X0900FCSTDPB080CW444GXX` | `0600X0900`: trim size 6” x 9” <br>`FC`: full color<br>`STD`: standard quality<br>`PB`: perfect binding<br>`080CW444`: 80# coated white paper with a bulk of 444 ppi<br>`G`: gloss cover coating<br>`X`: no linen<br>`X`: no foil|
    | `0700X1000FCPRECO060UC444MXX` | 7" x 10" black-and-white premium coil-bound book printed on 60# cream paper with a matte cover |
    | `0600X0900BWSTDPB060UW444MXX` | 6" x 9" black-and-white standard quality paperback book printed on 60# white paper with a matte cover |

    ## Create a Print-Job
    Now you can start to create Print-Jobs. A Print-Job request consists of at least three data fields:

    * `line_items` **(required)**: the list of books that shall be printed
    * `shipping_address` **(required)**: the (end) customer’s address where Lulu should send the books - including a phone number.
    * `contact_email` **(required)**: an email address for questions regarding the Print-Job - normally, you want to use the email address of a developer or shop owner, not the end customer
    * `shipping_level`**(required)**: Lulu offers five different quality levels for shipping:
        * `MAIL` - Slowest ship method. Depending on the destination, tracking might not be available.
        * `PRIORITY_MAIL` - priority mail shipping
        * `GROUND` - Courier based shipping using ground transportation in the US.
        * `EXPEDITED` - expedited (2nd day) delivery via air mail or equivalent
        * `EXPRESS` - overnight delivery. Fastest shipping available.
    * `external_id` (optional): a reference number to link the Print-Job to your system (e.g. your order number)

    The **shipping address must contain a phone number**. This is required by our shipping carriers. If the shipping address does not contain a phone number, the default phone number from the account will be used.
    If neither the account nor the shipping address contain a phone number, the Print-Job can not be created.

    You can find the detailed documentation for [Creating a new Print-Job](#) below.

    ## Check Print-Job Status
    After sending a Print-Job, you can check its status. Normally, a Print-Job goes through the following stages:

    <img src="/api-docs/assets/print-job-stages.svg">

    * **CREATED**: Print-Job created
    * **UNPAID**: Print-Job can be paid
    * **PAYMENT_IN_PROGRESS**: Payment is in Progress
    * **PRODUCTION_DELAYED**: Print-Job is paid and will move to production after the mandatory production delay.
    * **PRODUCTION_READY**: Production delay has ended and the Print-Job will move to "in production" shortly.
    * **IN_PRODUCTION**: Print-Job submitted to printer
    * **SHIPPED**: Print-Job is fully shipped

    There are a few more status that can occur when there is a problem with the Print-Job:
    * **REJECTED**: When there is a problem with the input data or the file, Lulu will reject a Print-Job with a detailed error message. Please [contact our experts](https://help.api.lulu.com) if you need help in resolving this issue.
    * **CANCELED**: You can cancel a Print-Job as long as it is “unpaid” using an API request to the status endpoint. In rare cases, Lulu might also cancel a Print-Job if a problem has surfaced in production and the order cannot be fulfilled.

    ## Shipping Notification
    Once an order has been shipped, Lulu will provide tracking information in the Print-Job endpoint.

        \ (datetime with minute precision)\n * `2017-11-09T09:30:08` (datetime with\

        \ `PRODUCTION_READY`, `PRODUCTION_DELAYED`, `IN_PRODUCTION`, `ERROR`, `SHIPPED`,\

      description: 'Print-Jobs are the core resource of the Print API. A Printjob
        consists of line items, shipping information and some additional metadata.


        ## Elements of a Print-Job

        ### Line Items

        A line item represents a book that should be printed or in short a **printable**.
        Printables consist of cover and interior files as well as a `pod_package_id`.
        The `pod_package_id` represents the manufacturing options; see the ["Select
        a product"](#section/Select-a-Product) section for details. Each printable
        can be identified by an immutable `printable_id`. The `printable_id` can be
        used for re-orders so that the files don''t have to be transferred again.


        ### Shipping Information & Metadata

        Print-Jobs have to contain a `shipping_address` as well as a `shipping_level`.
        Lulu offers five different service levels that differ in speed and traceability.


        ### Additional Metadata

        A few additional metadata fields can be specified in the Print-Job as well:

        * `contact_email` for questions related to the Print-Job itself

        * `production_delay` allows you to specify a delay (between 60 minutes and
        a full day) before the Print-Job goes to production.

        * `external_id` allows you to link the Print-Job to an internal order number
        or other reference.


        ## File Handling and Normalization

        Interior and cover files have to be specified with a URL from which Lulu can
        download the files. Using encoded [basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication#URL_encoding)
        in the URL is ok. All files processed by Lulu will be validated and normalized
        before sending them to production. If problems with the file occur, the PrintJob
        will be rejected or cancelled and an error message will be displayed.


        ## Automation and Payment

        After a Print-Job has been created successfully, it will remain in an `UNPAID`
        state until it is paid for through the developer portal. However, you can
        automate the process by putting a credit card on file. Then, the Print-Job
        will automatically transition to the `PRODUCTION_DELAY` status and your card
        will charged when the Print-Job is sent to production.

          ### Usage of printable_id

          The immutable `printable_id` can be used for re-orders so that the files don''t have
          to be transferred again.
          Given there is an already created and validated Print-Job, you can use
          the `printable_id` of each line-item to create re-orders for that particular printable.
          As the normalized files are already on the server, you omit the complete `printable_normalization`
          object from the request and send a valid `printable_id` instead.

          ### Shipping Information & Metadata

          Print-Jobs have to contain a `shipping_address` as well as a `shipping_level`.
          Lulu offers five different service levels that differ in speed and traceability.


          ### Additional Metadata

          A few additional metadata fields can be specified in the Print-Job as well:

          * `contact_email` for questions related to the Print-Job itself

          * `production_delay` allows you to specify a delay (between 60 minutes and
          a full day) before the Print-Job goes to production.

          * `external_id` allows you to link the Print-Job to an internal order number
          or other reference.

          ## File Handling and Normalization

          If there is an existing printable for the given `printable_id` the already
          processed and normalized files are used for production. If there are are
          problems with the `printable_id`, the PrintJob will be rejected or cancelled
          and an error message will be displayed.

          ## Automation and Payment

          After a Print-Job has been created successfully, it will remain in an `UNPAID`
          state until it is paid for through the developer portal. However, you can
          automate the process by putting a credit card on file. Then, the Print-Job
          will automatically transition to the `PRODUCTION_DELAY` status and your card
          will charged when the Print-Job is sent to production.

        When integrating the Print API with your own shop, you might want
        to give customers an option to select among different shipping_levels.

        This endpoint allows you to request available shipping methods (including
        cost) with minimal input data. Typically you want to specify

        the following parameters in a query:

        * `iso_country_code`

        * `fastest_per_level`

        * `quantity`

        * `pod_package_id`

        * `currency` only required if you don''t want USD


        You can further restrict shipping options that support post box delivery by
        adding `postbox_ok=true` to your query.

        When integrating the Print API with your own shop, you might want to give customers an option to select among different shipping levels.
        This endpoint allows you to request available shipping methods (including cost) with minimal input data:
        * `country`
        * `page_count`
        * `quantity`
        * `pod_package_id`
        * `currency` only required if you don't want USD

        You can further restrict shipping options that support post box delivery by adding `is_postbox=true` to your shipping address data.

Before going digital, you might benefit from scribbling down some ideas in a sketchbook. This way, you can think things through before committing to an actual design project.

But then I found a component library based on Tailwind CSS called Flowbite. It comes with the most commonly used UI components, such as buttons, navigation bars, cards, form elements, and more which are conveniently built with the utility classes from Tailwind CSS.

Getting started with Flowbite
First of all you need to understand how Flowbite works. This library is not another framework. Rather, it is a set of components based on Tailwind CSS that you can just copy-paste from the documentation.

It also includes a JavaScript file that enables interactive components, such as modals, dropdowns, and datepickers which you can optionally include into your project via CDN or NPM.

You can check out the quickstart guide to explore the elements by including the CDN files into your project. But if you want to build a project with Flowbite I recommend you to follow the build tools steps so that you can purge and minify the generated CSS.

You'll also receive a lot of useful application UI, marketing UI, and e-commerce pages that can help you get started with your projects even faster. You can check out this comparison table to better understand the differences between the open-source and pro version of Flowbite.

When does design come in handy?
While it might seem like extra work at a first glance, here are some key moments in which prototyping will come in handy:

1. **Usability testing.** Does your user know how to exit out of screens? Can they follow your intended user journey and buy something from the site you’ve designed? By running a usability test, you’ll be able to see how users will interact with your design once it’s live;
1. Involving stakeholders. Need to check if your GDPR consent boxes are displaying properly? Pass your prototype to your data protection team and they can test it for real;
1. Impressing a client. Prototypes can help explain or even sell your idea by providing your client with a hands-on experience;
1. Communicating your vision. By using an interactive medium to preview and test design elements, designers and developers can understand each other — and the project — better.

Let's start by including the CSS file inside the head tag of your HTML.

{/* # HelloMe.aiâ€™s Accessibility Statement */}

HelloMe.ai is committed to providing a positive experience to all our customers and we aim to facilitate the accessibility and usability of our website. Our goal is to permit our customers to successfully gather information and transact business through our website, whether you are using assistive technologies, like a screen reader, magnifier, voice recognition software, or captions for videos.

### Accessibility Assistance

HelloMe.ai.com makes available the UserWay's Web Accessibility Widget, which is powered by a dedicated accessibility server. The software allows www.hellome.ai to improve its compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1).

The HelloMe.ai.com accessibility menu can be enabled by clicking the accessibility menu icon that appears on the bottom right corner of the page. After triggering the accessibility menu, please wait a moment for the accessibility menu to load in its entirety.

### Ongoing Effort

At HelloMe.ai, we are proud of the efforts that we have completed and that are in-progress to ensure that our website is accessible to everyone. We view accessibility as an ongoing effort and are continually seeking solutions that will allow seamless, accessible and unhindered use also for those of us with disabilities across all areas of our website.

In an ongoing effort to continually improve and remediate accessibility issues, we also regularly scan www.hellome.ai with UserWay's Accessibility Scanner to identify and fix every possible accessibility barrier on our site. Despite our efforts to make all pages and content on www.hellome.ai fully accessible, some content may not have yet been fully adapted to the strictest accessibility standards. This may be a result of not having found or identified the most appropriate technological solution.

## How-To

Source: <https://www.astria.ai/tips>

- Upload 10-20 pictures of your subject. Preferably shot or cropped to 1:1 aspect ratio.
- We recommend uploading 3 photos of full body or entire object + 5 medium shot photos from the chest up + 10 close ups.
  Variation is key - Change body pose for every picture, use pictures from different days backgrounds and lighting, and show a variety of expressions and emotions. Make sure you capture the subject's eyes looking in different - directions for different images, take one with closed eyes. Every picture of your subject should introduce new info about your subject.
  Whatever you capture will be over-represented, so things you don't want to get associated with your subject should change in every shot. Always pick a new background, even if that means moving a little bit to shift the - background.
- Super important - Pick a good className. Something broad that you could associate your subject with. What works best? We donâ€™t know! Please experiment and share!
- When constructing your prompts, always include "sks className" to represent the subject.
